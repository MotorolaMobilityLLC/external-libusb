=======

libusbx is a library for USB device access from Linux, Mac OS X,
OpenBSD and Windows userspace.
It is written in C and licensed under the LGPL-2.1 (see COPYING).

libusbx is abstracted internally in such a way that it can hopefully
be ported to other operating systems. Please see the PORTING file
for more information.
